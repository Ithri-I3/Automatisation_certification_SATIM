# Automatisation_certification_SATIM
  Automation of the web merchant certification process on the SATIM platform.

The aim of this project is to fully automate the certification process for web merchants on the SATIM ( interbank transaction automation and electronic banking company ) platform. Currently, this process is manual, resulting in relatively long certification times. Automation will significantly reduce these delays and optimize the testing and validation stages.
